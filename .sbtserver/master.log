The de.csmath.codec.Codec$ source file has the following regular definitions changed:
	needPads.
All member reference dependencies will be considered within this context.
Files invalidated by inheriting from (external) de.csmath.codec.Codec$: Set(); now invalidating by inheritance (internally).
Getting direct dependencies of all sources transitively invalidated by inheritance.
Getting sources that directly depend on (external) de.csmath.codec.Codec$.
